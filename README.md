# paracell-docs
This is the compiled documentation inside the `docs/_build/html` folder of Paracell.

The existence of this repository is to keep the main Paracell repo clean and not contain compiled files.

The `.nojekyll` file is so that the css and js files inside _static are served properly by GitHub pages.

Installation
============

Prerequisites
-------------
Paracell can be installed using pip. Python (and preferably a Python environment), should be installed.

If you want xFormers to speed up DINO deep feature extraction, install xFormers first. See the `xFormers installation instructions <https://github.com/facebookresearch/xformers#installing-xformers>`_ for more information. It's recommended to install ``torch`` and ``torchvision`` alongside xFormers.

Example code:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install -U xformers --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
   pip install torch==2.6.0 torchvision==0.21.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118

Main Installation
-----------------
1. Clone the `Paracell GitHub repository <https://github.com/chaolabcanada/paracell>`_ into a folder.

   .. code-block:: bash

      git clone https://github.com/chaolabcanada/paracell.git

2. In the terminal, navigate to the root of the Paracell directory.

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd paracell

3. Install Paracell as experimental. Dependencies are installed automatically by pip.

   .. code-block:: bash

      pip install -e .

   For development, make sure to install dev dependencies.

   .. code-block:: bash

      pip install -e .[dev]

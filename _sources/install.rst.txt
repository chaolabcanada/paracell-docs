Installation
============

Prerequisites
-------------
Paracell can be installed using pip. Python (and preferably a Python environment), should be installed.

If you want xFormers to speed up DINO deep feature extraction, install xFormers first. See the `xFormers installation instructions <https://github.com/facebookresearch/xformers#installing-xformers>`_ for more information. It's recommended to install ``torch`` and ``torchvision`` alongside xFormers.

Main Installation
-----------------
1. Clone the `Paracell GitHub repository <https://github.com/chaolabcanada/paracell>`_ into a folder.

   .. code-block:: bash

      git clone https://github.com/chaolabcanada/paracell.git

2. In the terminal, navigate to the root of the Paracell directory.

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd paracell

3. Install Paracell as experimental. Dependencies are install automatically by pip.

   .. code-block:: bash

      pip install -e .

   For development, make sure to install dev dependencies.

   .. code-block:: bash

      pip install -e .[dev]

After Installation
------------------

- Paracell CLI can be run with the ``paracell`` command. More info: :doc:`Paracell CLI Guide <cli>`.

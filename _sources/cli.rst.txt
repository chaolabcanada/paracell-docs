Command Line Interface
======================

After installing, Paracell can be run directly through the terminal with the ``paracell`` command. This runs the ``cli.py`` file in the Paracell module.

Paracell will list its commands when running ``paracell`` or the help command (``paracell --help``).

Run ``paracell --help <command>`` to get more information on a command.

   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 75
   :class: align-left

**Description**:

   This command does illumination correction, segmentation, and feature extraction.

   1. It begins by illumination correcting all images, if enabled.
   2. It preforms segmentation, with specified Cellpose model and channels.
   3. Runs specified analyses on every segmented cell.

Training
--------
.. code-block:: bash

   paracell train <path-to-config>

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

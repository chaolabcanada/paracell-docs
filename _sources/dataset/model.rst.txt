Model Output
============

This is the output folder for training a model. It has the following structure.

.. code-block:: text

   <output folder>
   ├── tensorboard
   │   └── tensorboard files
   ├── model checkpoints
   ├── config.yaml
   └── train.log

TensorBoard Folder
------------------

This folder contains the TensorBoard data:

Per epoch:

   - Learning rate.
   - Train loss.

Per checkpoint epoch:

- Validation loss.
- Average precision at IoU 50, 75 and averaged between 50 to 95 (50:90). AP50, AP75, and AP respectively.
- Average precision at IoU 50:90 for small, medium, and large objects. APs, APm, APl respectively.
- Average recall at IoU 50:90 for 1, 10, and 100 of the most confident detections. AR1, AR10, AR100 respectively.
- Average recall at IoU 50:90 for small, medium, and large objects. ARs, ARm, ARl respectively.

AP and AR are calculated using `COCO evaluator <https://pypi.org/project/pycocotools/>`_. For more information about AP and AR, click `here <https://www.picsellia.com/post/coco-evaluation-metrics-explained>`_.

Model Checkpoints
-----------------

The ``<model_name>.pt`` file is the fully trained model, after all training epochs have passed.

For every checkpoint epoch, a checkpoint model, ``<model_name>_best_epoch_<epoch>.pt`` or ``<model_name>_worse_epoch_<epoch>.pt``, is saved.

Config
------

A copy of the model's training config, is copied into the folder as ``config.yaml``.

Logs
----

``train.log`` is a text file containing details about how the training went.

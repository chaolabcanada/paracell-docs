Training Dataset
================

This dataset is typically used to train and validate three channel Cellpose models, trained by Paracell. The dataset consist of image and seg pairs. For example, ``name.tif`` would have a corresponding ``name_seg.npy`` file.

Images
------

These are single ``.tif`` files where the image channels correspond to specific fluorescence channels. The order channels are stacked is *arbitrary*, so the colouring in RGB is also arbitrary.

Typically, the red channel is DAPI, and the green channel is Cyan. This is the structure of images in the `cyto2 dataset <https://www.cellpose.org/dataset>`_. Paracell's three channel model puts FITC in the blue channel.

.. warning::

   Older Paracell models have DAPI in the blue channel and FITC in the red channel. Double check image channels are what you expect them to be when training and evaluating.

Seg Files
---------

Segmentation files containing at least ``masks``. It's highly recommended that ``cl_computed_flows`` is included as well. These fils typically have the format described :doc:`here <seg>`, however, only ``masks`` and ``cl_computed_flows`` are required for the Paracell training script.

.. caution::
   Training recomputes ``cl_computed_flows`` if not present, but this happens every epoch. Computing flows is a slow operation.

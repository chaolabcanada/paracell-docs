Pseudolabel Output
==================

The pseudolabelling pipeline's output is the same as the :doc:`analysis pipeline output <pipeline_output>`, except with a few extra folders.

Structure:

.. code-block:: text

   <output folder>
   ├── merged/
   ├── train/
   ├── test/
   ├── holdout/
   └── analysis pipeline outputs

Train/Test/Holdout
------------------

These folders all contain image, seg pairs. These folders are of the :doc:`training pipeline format <training>`. Each folder contains a non-overlapping subset of the images. The percentage each folder contains, depends on the parameters set in config.

.. note::

   The inclusion of ``cl_computed_flows`` in the :doc:`seg <seg>` files, depends on the config. There may also be other pseudolabelling related properties.

Temporary Files/Folders
-----------------------

While running analysis, there are temporary files and folders created.

Merged
^^^^^^

This folder initial1ly contains all the stacked coloured images of FOVs, which will later be moved to the train, test, and holdout folders.

Filtered Seg Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These are files ending with ``_filtered_seg.npy`` or ``_filtered_seg.npz``. These are generated while the normal seg files get filtered for GFP+ cells. They are moved into the train, test, and holdout folders.

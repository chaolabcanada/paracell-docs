Seg Files
=========
Files ending in ``_seg.npy`` or ``_seg.npz`` are seg files. These store the segmentation data, such as masks. This is a modified version of `Cellpose's format <https://cellpose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/outputs.html#seg-npy-output>`_.

- The npy files are compatible with `Cellpose's seg files <https://cellpose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/outputs.html#seg-npy-output>`_.
- The npz are compressed versions of npy files. Generally masks compress well, but flows do not.

Depending on the pipeline being run, paracell may add a few additional properties to the cellpose seg format:

- ``mask_probabilities`` List of cell probabilities, per cell.
   - First item corresponds to cell with mask idx 1, so on.
   - Derived from flows.
   - Present on segs saved from segmentors.

.. _cl_computed_flows_description:

- ``cl_computed_flows``: Alternative Cellpose flows.
   - Used for Paracell three channel training.
   - Generated only by pseudolabelling and adding flows to hand-labelled datasets.
   - Numpy array of shape [4, H, W]. It's the output of Cellpose's ``dynamics.labels_to_flows``. It contains:
      0. Copy of masks.
      1. Cell probability/cell distance transform.
      2. Y flows.
      3. X flows.
- ``cached_masks``: Masks, but includes all cells, not just GFP.
   -  Used for pseudolabelling refinement in the GUI.
- ``cell_threshold_values``: Dict with keys ``fitc_average``, ``cyan_sub``, ``red_percentage``. The values are an array, with items corresponding to each cell, similar to ``mask_probabilities``.
   - Used for thresholding the pseudolabels.

.. note::

   Typically Cellpose's ``flows`` aren't saved to conserve space.

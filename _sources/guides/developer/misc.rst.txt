Misc
====

This page contains random tips about Paracell which aren't long enough for their own section.

improcess
---------

There are a lot of useful functions inside ``paracell.improcess`` for image processing.

It's recommended to have a look inside ``paracell.improcess.ops``!

Outlines
--------

Mask formatted image, but every mask only contains the pixels on the edge.

Flows
-----

Cellpose doesn't have one format of flows.

- The flows saved in the seg files, follow the one listed in the `output formats <https://cellpose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/outputs.html#seg-npy-output>`_ of Cellpose.
- The flows output of the ``CellposeModel`` are slightly different, which is listed in their `documentation <https://cellpose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#id0>`_.
- ``cl_computed_flows`` are :reF:`Paracell's format <cl_computed_flows_description>` used for training.

Testing
-------

Paracell has some tests in the ``tests`` folder. These can be run using ``pytest``. After navigating into the root of the Paracell repository.

.. code-block:: bash

  python -m pytest .

MKL
---

The default BLAS numpy uses, openblas, may not work properly on some Intel CPUs. If you see a large portion of the CPU being used by system calls (``sy`` in the ``top`` command), while running Paracell feature extraction, try switching to `MKL <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/distribution-python-download.html>`_.

When using MKL, make sure to import numpy first, before other packages. This avoids MKL related errors. This done automatically in the Paracell cli, but you will have to do this when using Paracell as a library.

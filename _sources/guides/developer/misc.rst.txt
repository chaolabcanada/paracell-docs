Misc
====

This page contains random tips about Paracell which aren't long enough for their own section.

improcess
---------

There are a lot of useful functions inside ``paracell.improcess`` for image processing.

It's recommended to have a look inside ``paracell.improcess.ops``!

Outlines
--------

Mask formatted image, but every mask only contains the pixels on the edge.

Flows
-----

Cellpose doesn't have one format of flows.

- The flows saved in the seg files, follow the one listed in the `output formats <https://cellpose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/outputs.html#seg-npy-output>`_ of Cellpose.
- The flows output of the ``CellposeModel`` are slightly different, which is listed in their `documentation <https://cellpose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#id0>`_.
- ``cl_computed_flows`` are :reF:`Paracell's format <cl_computed_flows_description>` used for training.

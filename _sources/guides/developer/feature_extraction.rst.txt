Feature Extraction
==================

Often we want to extract morphological features from single cells for downstream analysis, such as clustering and classification.

The ``paracell.feature_extraction`` module provides classes for extracting features. More specifically, the classes inside ``vision`` and ``dfe``.

For the following sections, we assume that ``fov`` has channels loaded, cells segmented and created. We also assume that ``cell = fov.cells[0]`` or any cell (this is for the sake of example). The tutorial will use the ``ThreeChannelCellposeSegmentor`` for the ``fov`` examples that follow.

Conventional Feature Extraction
-------------------------------

``paracell.feature_extraction.vision`` uses computer vision to extract conventional features.

For this tutorial, we will use ``BasicShapeAnalysis``, but all the other analysis classes (ones that extend ``CellAnalysisMixin``) work the same way. You call ``analyze_cell`` on a class instance.

.. code-block:: python

   from paracell.feature_extraction.vision import BasicShapeAnalysis

   BasicShapeAnalysis().analyze_cell(cell, fov)

This will add the analysis information into the cell statistics dictionary. The names of all features are generally upper snake case, with the prefix being all uppercase with underscores.

Format: ``<PREFIX>__<Property>``

One analysis added by BasicShapeAnalysis is the area of the cell, ``BASIC_SHAPE__Area``, which can be accessed using ``cell.get_statistic``

.. code-block:: python

   cell.get_statistic("BASIC_SHAPE__Area")

You can also convert the cell into a dictionary. This is useful for turning cells into Pandas DataFrames.

.. code-block:: python

   cell.to_dict()

Deep Feature Extraction
-----------------------

``paracell.feature_extraction.dfe`` provides classes for extracting deep features using DINOv2.

The classes work the same way as conventional features. Here's an example:

.. code-block:: python

   from paracell.feature_extraction.dfe import DINOv2FeatureExtractor

   DINOv2FeatureExtractor().analyze_cell(cell, fov)

   # Access a deep feature
   cell.get_statistic("DINO__DAPI_feature_1")

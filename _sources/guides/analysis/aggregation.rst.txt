Aggregation
===========

After preforming :doc:`segmentation and feature extraction (FE) <feature_extraction>`, the cell aggregation needs to be preformed and analysis specific metadata need to be added.

For these experiments, we can use the preprocess functions inside ``paracell.analysis``. Skeleton code is available inside the `aggregation_qa notebook <https://github.com/chaolabcanada/paracell/blob/main/paracell/analysis/aggregation_qa.ipynb>`_.

In the config options section, fill out the variables.

- ``PLATE_NAME``: Name of the plate. Should match that used for FE. 
- ``PLATE_DATA_PATH``: ``output_dir`` from FE.
- ``PLATEMAP_PATH``: Path to the platemap csv for this plate. It contains the variant information for each well.
- ``AGGREGATE_SAVE_PATH``: Path to save the aggregated data. Make sure this is a parquet file.

After filling out the variables, you can just run all the notebook tabs.

.. note::

   The current filtering done is removing cells with perimeter \<= 100 pixels, area \<= 900 pixels\ :sup:`2`, or cells which are Pbase. If any of these filtering properties needs to be reduced or removed, ``plate_info_to_parquet`` will need modifications. Otherwise, further filtering can be done during analysis in the notebook.
